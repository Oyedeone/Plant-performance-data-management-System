Project Title: Plant Performance Data Management and Visualization

Description:

Discover a comprehensive solution for effective plant performance data management and visualization. Our project seamlessly integrates a user-friendly MS Access GUI as the frontend, empowering operators to efficiently input production line data into a robust MySQL database. Through Python and Pandas, we leverage automation to transform and transfer existing production data from Excel documents, ensuring accuracy and enhancing data visualization.

Key Features:

User-Friendly MS Access GUI: Simplify data entry for operators with an intuitive graphical interface.

MySQL Database Integration: Establish a robust backend for secure and organized storage of plant performance data.

Python-Pandas Automation: Streamline data manipulation and transfer processes for increased efficiency.

Power BI Integration: Harness the power of Power BI for advanced tracking of essential plant performance metrics. Monitor OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency), mean time between repair, mean time between failure, availability, utilization, and more.

Data Visualization: Unlock insights with powerful visualization tools, enabling informed decision-making.

Excel Data Transformation: Seamlessly migrate existing production data from Excel to the database with precision.

Problem Deployment: Deployment of production lines  bottlenecks with MS Access

Shift Report: Automated creation and dispatch of daily production reports using MS Access through email
